void setup() {
  const char uri_write_message[] = "st.com/st25";       // Uri message to write in the tag
  const char uri_write_protocol[] = URI_ID_0x01_STRING; // Uri protocol to write in the tag
  String uri_write = String(uri_write_protocol) + String(uri_write_message);
  String uri_read;

  // Initialize serial for output.
  SerialPort.begin(115200);

  // The wire instance used can be omitted in case you use default Wire instance
  if(st25dv.begin() == 0) {
    SerialPort.println("System Init done!");
  } else {
    SerialPort.println("System Init failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  if(st25dv.writeURI(uri_write_protocol, uri_write_message, "")) {
    SerialPort.println("Write failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  delay(100);
  
  if(st25dv.readURI(&uri_read)) {
    SerialPort.println("Read failed!");
    while(1);
  }

  SerialPort.println(uri_read.c_str());

  if(strcmp(uri_read.c_str(), uri_write.c_str()) == 0) {
    SerialPort.println("Successfully written and read!");
  } else {
    SerialPort.println("Read bad string!");
  }
}

void loop() {  
  //empty loop
} 
```

- **Step 4.** Upload the demo. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [How to upload code](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

- **Step 5.** Open the **Serial Monitor** of Arduino IDE by click **Tool-> Serial Monitor**. You will get below result:

#### Test

After uploading the provided program to your Arduino, your Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) becomes a fully functioning NFC Tag, which can operate independently. You can remove it from your Arduino board; it doesn't require any additional setup to work.

To test its functionality, you'll need an NFC-enabled smartphone, either Android or Apple. For the purpose of this demonstration, an iPhone 14 Pro Max was used. The NFC antenna for this device is located adjacent to the camera. However, if you are unsure about the location of the NFC antenna on your smartphone, it would be beneficial to look it up online.

Place the phone's NFC antenna close to the NFC antenna of the Grove - NFC (ST25DV64). Your smartphone should display a prompt requesting to open a webpage at st.com. This response indicates that your Grove - NFC (ST25DV64) is functioning correctly as an NFC Tag and demonstrates the demo's functionality.
